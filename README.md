## sql-list-query-test-task

### The task:
 In an SQL database, there is a table called `product_recommendation` with columns `id`, `product_id1`, 
 and `product_id2`.
 The `id` column is the primary key, and the other two columns are foreign keys referencing the `product` table
 (the specific structure of which is not relevant for this task). All columns are of type integer.
 The `product_recommendation` table contains several million records.

 In a Java application, there is an array or any collection (of your choice) containing 100,000 product IDs
 (also integers). The goal is to obtain a list of all recommendations (rows from the `product_recommendation` table)
 where `product_id1` is NOT in this array/collection.

 Outline the main steps for solving this task and provide the main SQL query that needs to be executed in the process.

### Train of thoughts:

1. There are two solutions I can name right off the bat: 
   1. Load the collection into a `select * from product_recommendation where product_id1 not in (:list)` and 
      pray for the database to parse it, not to raise exceptions about arguments list being too long, etc.
   2. Utilise some kind of temporary table, and run a query like `select pr.* from product_recommendation pr join 
      tmp_table tt on pr.product_id1 <> tt.id`. This should work faster, but we still need some time to populate 
      the temporary table. It should go faster with batching, though.
2. Various frameworks may work with different efficiency. And they each will require tuning. 
3. Look up any other viable options in the Internet:
   1. [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-jdbctemplate-in-list) mentions a temporary table.
   2. [An answer on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/a/32561721/7643283) mentions passing list as a concatenated string. 
4. Ask ChatGPT-3.5: was down back then. I ran it after I was done with this task. 
   
   """

   To obtain a list of all recommendations where `product_id1` is not in the given array/collection, you can follow these main steps:
   Convert the array/collection of product IDs to a format suitable for SQL query execution. This can be achieved by either creating a temporary table in the database or constructing a comma-separated string of the product IDs.
   Use the SQL `NOT IN` operator to retrieve the recommendations where product_id1 is not present in the array/collection of product IDs.
   Here is the main SQL query that needs to be executed:
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM product_recommendation
    WHERE product_id1 NOT IN (/* Insert the array/collection of product IDs here */);
    ```
    Ensure that you replace the comment /* Insert the array/collection of product IDs here */ with the actual array or collection of product IDs in the appropriate format.

    """
    
    Which is basically what I have done. 

6. As I have no work and 2 days to complete this test task, let's try to compare the approaches.
6. I will use PostgreSQL as the database. Using different RDBMS is also interesting, but this will bloat out 
   the task I want to do too much.

### Difficulties

1. It was nasty to write JooQ queries with PostgreSQL-specific syntax. 
   For example in `insert into excluded_ids(id) select unnest(string_to_array(?, ','))::integer` the `unnest` operator
   is acting weird in Postgres and thus is badly supported by JooQ. Or I haven't figured the right way to use it an spent
   some hours figuring it out.
2. Generating random 5M data took about a minute on my machine, so I decide not to run 50M tests. I believe this time 
   can be improved by a lot by generating the data first, and applying the limitations
   (pk and fk indices and fk constraints) after the data was created, but I simply don't have enough time 
   to polish this test.

### Approaches

So far, there are three main approaches:
1. Naive, just pass the collection as is and check `product_id1 not in (:list)`.
2. Pass a concatenated string instead and do the same check.
3. 4\. 5\. Use temporary table and join it against the `product_recommendation` table. This leads to three different
approaches on how to insert data into it, however: naive in loop, with a concatenated string and with batches. 

### Tests

The first run with 500k products, 5M recommendations and 100k query elements took 11:32 time units and returned 
the following result:

QueryBenchmark.temporaryTableBatchedApproach              avgt        3.950           s/op
```

This benchmark run had only 1 run 
and none warmups. I used it to determine what benchmark mode will suit this test the best and decided it was `AvgTime`.

Second approach was done on 500k data and 10k, 100k and 1M elements in request. The part done on 5M supposedly gets stuck 
with 100% cpu usage on temporary table approaches, so I decided to eliminate some long runs.

```

In those charts, the lower runtime is, the faster the approach is. And it seems like having a concatenated string of ids
wins in this case, when one column is only 4 bytes wide. However, in my experience, approach with a temporary table is 
faster when the table is wider with optional ~200 char text fields and there are concurrent reads and writes
to the main table.

### Conclusion

Anyway, it seems like the winner is `concatenatedStringApproach`, and the resulting sql query is 
`select id from product_recommendation pr where not (pr.product_id1 = any(string_to_array(?, ',')::integer[]))`,
given the argument is passed as a comma-joined string of integers. (e.g. `1,2,34,56,789`)
